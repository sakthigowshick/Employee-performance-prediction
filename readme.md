# üë®‚Äçüíº Employee Performance Prediction

This project applies **Machine Learning** to predict employee **Performance Ratings** based on demographic, HR, and productivity-related features.

---

## üìÇ Dataset Description

The dataset includes employee information such as:

- **Age**
- **Years of Experience**
- **Department**
- **Education Level**
- **Hire Year**
- **Hours Worked**
- **Projects Handled**
- **Trainings Attended**
- **Job Satisfaction (1‚Äì5)**
- **Productivity Score**

üéØ **Target Variable:** `Performance Score`

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation Matrix
We generated a **heatmap** to check relationships between features.

![Correlation Matrix](output.png)

‚û°Ô∏è Observation:  
- **Productivity Score**, **Job Satisfaction**, and **Hours Worked** showed the strongest correlation with `Performance Score`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Distribution
Distribution of key features across employees:

![Feature Distribution](output2.png)

‚û°Ô∏è Observation:  
- Age and Experience follow a slightly skewed distribution.  
- Productivity scores are close to normal but with some outliers.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Confusion Matrix
Model evaluation with a confusion matrix:

‚û°Ô∏è Observation:  
- Most predictions were correct, but some misclassifications occurred between mid-range performance categories.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

- **Random Forest** and **AdaBoost** achieved the best results.  
- **Productivity Score, Hours Worked, and Job Satisfaction** were the most influential features.  
- Visualizations (correlation + distributions) confirmed the relationships between work habits and performance.  
- Confusion Matrix revealed that errors mainly happened in mid-performance ratings.
